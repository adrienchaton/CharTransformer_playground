# Specific vocabulary and definitions for biology dummy


## General / Misc.


* Amino acids = 20+2 proteinogenic are the precursors to proteins + other non-proteinogenic.

* Proteins are large biomolecules that comprise one or more long chains of amino acid residues. They are defined by their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes. It usually results in protein folding into a specific 3D structure that determines the activity. Shorter polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides. 3 main protein functions. Enzymes which catalyse chemical reactions. Cell signaling and ligand binding e.g. messenger (protein hormones), immune system flag (antibody). Structural proteins confer stiffness and rigidity to otherwise-fluid biological components e.g. collagen and elastin.

* Amino acid residue = the unique part of amino acids that is left over when the identical features of amino acids are removed = the unique portion of an amino acid which gives its specific function -> each amino acid = Amine + Carboxylic Acid + Residue. When there is a protein contact, this can be done through residue-residue interactions.

* Nucleotides = monomeric units of the nucleic acid polymers e.g. DNA (A,C,G,T) and RNA (A,C,G,U).

* DNA is a molecule composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic instructions.

* RNA is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes.

* Genes are basic units of heredity and sequences of nucleotides in DNA that encode the synthesis of a gene product, either RNA or proteins.


## Proteins

* Protein synthesis = transcription and translation. Transcription = conversion of the gene instruction of DNA into mRNA fed to ribosome. Translation = ribosome uses the mRNA instruction as well as its own rRNA and tRNA to write the corresponding protein.

* Primary structure of a protein = the linear sequence of its amino acids (AAs). By convention, the primary structure of a protein is read and written from the amino-terminal (N) to the carboxyl-terminal (C) end. Each amino acid is connected to the next by a peptide bond

* Secondary structure = the local arrangement of the chain in space. Several common secondary structures have been identified in proteins e.g. Alpha Helix, Beta Strands, Beta Turns and Random Coils.

* Tertiary structure = 3D folding.

* Quaternary structure = for proteins with two or more peptide chains forming subunits. The subunits can be different or identical, and in most cases they are arranged symmetrically. In general, a protein with two subunits is called a dimer; one with three subunits a trimer and one with four subunits a tetramer. Changes in quaternary structure can occur through e.g. reorientation of the subunits relative to each other.


## Immunology


Marshall / An introduction to immunology and immunopathology / 2018

* Immune system = protection to intruding pathogens through structural and chemical barriers as well as immunity mechanisms

* Innate immunity = fast and memoryless response, unspecific. E.g. endocytosis, phagocytose

* Adaptive immunity = antigen-dependent and antigen-specific response which has a memory enabling more rapid and efficient immune responses, upon subsequent exposure to the antigen -> lag time between exposure to the antigen and maximal response. Adaptive immunity can be activated through antigen-presenting cells (APCs), e.g. macrophages do both phagocytosis and antigen presentation to T cells -> messenger between innate and adaptive immunity. It leads to the recognition of specific “non-self” antigens and their destruction, as well as that of the cells they infected. The defense cells of the adaptive immune system include: antigen-specific T cells, which are activated to proliferate through the action of APCs, and B cells which differentiate into plasma cells to produce antibodies.

* Cell-mediated immune response = T cells & antibody-mediated immune response = B cells. In early phase of infection, antibodies play major role. Once the infection has established, cell-mediated immune response becomes prevalent.

* Pathogen = cause of infections e.g. microbes, viruses, cancer cells, toxins ... The pathogen surface has antigens which the immune system is trained at detecting.

* T cells = express unique antigen-binding receptors on their membrane, known as the T-cell receptor (TCR). Each T cell expresses a single type of TCR and proliferate/differentiate under the action of APCs that recognize a specific antigen. The surfaces of APCs express a group of proteins (major histocompatibility complex MHC) which display fragments of antigens (peptides) ~ marker. T cells are activated when they encounter an APC that has digested an antigen and is displaying the correct antigen fragments (peptides) bound to its MHC molecules.

* Antigen presentation = APC + antigen -> MHC -> binding to TCR -> multiplication and differentiation of T cells to fight the antigen, either Cytotoxic or Helper T Cells.

* B cells = express a unique antigen-binding receptor on their membrane. No need for APC but require the Th Cells to multiply into antibody producing cells for the identified antigen.

* Antigen-antibody complex = B cell ingests antigen + T cell helper (Th) secretes cytokines -> multiplication and differentiation of antibody producing plasma (B) cells and memory B cells -> antibodies lock onto matching antigens that are flagged for destruction

* Human immunoglobulin (Ig) antibodies produced by B cells = IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA, IgE

* Passive immunization = injection of active antibodies either manufactured ones or from one individual to another e.g. maternal antibodies

* Active immunization = antibodies produced after exposure to the pathogen e.g. natural infection or vaccine with a weakened form of the pathogen or a specific protein inducing immunitiy

* Immunopathology = malfunction of the immune system, either ineffective or overactive or against healthy self (autoimmunity)


An Introduction to Antibodies: Antigens, Epitopes and Antibodies

* Immunolabeling = a specific antibody will combine with its specific antigen to generate an exclusive antibody-antigen complex

* Antigen = substance responsible for an immune response via antibody generation e.g foreign proteins during an infection. The antigens are usually contained by the viruses and bacteria, either on their surface or inside. Vaccines can be developed by isolating antigens. Antigens are usually proteins but can also be polypeptides, lipids, nucleic acids, and many other materials.

* T cells require the action of APC to degrade the antigen into recognizable fragments. B cells have antibodies on their surface that allow to directly recognize the tertiary protein structure.

* Epitope = small site on an antigen to which a complementary antibody may specifically bind, e.g. five to eight amino acid residues. The range of possible binding sites on a target molecule (antigen) is enormous, with each potential binding site having its own structural properties affecting the antibody choice and performance.

* Conformational epitope = related to a specific 3D folding shape at a certain site. Linear epitope = only related to the flat sequence of amino acids.

* When the protein is chemically altered (denatured), the conformational epitope may be destroyed which causes the antibody not to bind. In that case antibody recognizing the linear epitope may be preferred. However sometimes the epitope may be hidden inside the protein folding, making inaccessible to the antibody in a non denaturing protocol. For that reason, conformational epitopes are usually considered to lie on the outside of the protein structure.

* An antibody that recognizes a linear epitope on the surface of a normally folded protein will work well in both nondenaturing (native cellular environment) and denaturing protocols.

* Antibody = immunoglobulin with the specific antigen binding property. For humans, they are a group of glycoproteins. The antibodies are involved in the humoral immunity.

* Antibody structure is based on Y-shaped units. Each Y contains two symetrical and identical branches, each containing a heavy chain and a light chain. The bottom tail of the Y is the constant Fc fragment only composed of the heavy chains. The upper arms of the Y are the variable F(ab) regions responsible for the antigen-specific binding and are composed of both heavy and light chains. The number of F(ab) regions in an antibody corresponds to its subclass and determines its valency = number of arms with which the antibody may bind to its antigen.

* The variable region of the antibody is divided into the framework region and the hyper-variable region. The hyper-variable region is also called Complementarity Determining Region (CDR) since it is the most determinent for the antigen-specific binding.

* Five antibody classes: IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE, based on the number of Y units and the type of heavy chain.


Sela-Culang / The structural basis of antibody-antigen recognition / 2013


* Basic view of antibody structure-functions = Complementarity Determining Region (CDR) = six hypervariable loops = antigen recognition & constant region = mediate with the immune system effectors --> over-simplification because some CDR residues seem to never participate in binding while some off-CDR residues (framework and constant regions) seem to play a role in Ab-Ag interaction.
