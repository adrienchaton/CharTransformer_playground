## Immunology

* Immune system = protection to intruding pathogens through structural and chemical barriers as well as immunity mechanisms

* Innate immunity = fast and memoryless response, unspecific. E.g. endocytosis, phagocytose

* Adaptive immunity = antigen-dependent and antigen-specific response which has a memory enabling more rapid and efficient immune responses, upon subsequent exposure to the antigen -> lag time between exposure to the antigen and maximal response. Adaptive immunity can be activated through antigen-presenting cells (APCs), e.g. macrophages do both phagocytosis and antigen presentation to T cells -> messenger between innate and adaptive immunity. It leads to the recognition of specific “non-self” antigens and their destruction, as well as that of the cells they infected. The defense cells of the adaptive immune system include: antigen-specific T cells, which are activated to proliferate through the action of APCs, and B cells which differentiate into plasma cells to produce antibodies.  

* Antigen = cause of infections e.g. microbes, viruses, cancer cells, toxins ... ~ pathogen

* T cells = express unique antigen-binding receptors on their membrane, known as the T-cell receptor (TCR). Each T cell expresses a single type of TCR and proliferate/differentiate under the action of APCs that recognize a specific antigen. The surfaces of APCs express a group of proteins (major histocompatibility complex MHC) which display fragments of antigens (peptides) ~ marker.
